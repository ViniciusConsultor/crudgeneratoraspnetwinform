#summary Changelog for changes in the working copy

= Introduction =

As I make some changes and assumptions, I will add them here.


= Details =

==SPROC CRUD GENERATOR v1.1==
 * Added very basic ability to save the current working session information so you don't have to enter the username, password, table name filter, and output directory each time you run the application.

==SPROC CRUD GENERATOR v1.0==
 * The generate drop if exists checkbox is now off by default - since it might overwrite customized content.
=== TODO ===
 * When the output to file checkbox is checked, the sql is generated but not executed.
 * add a stored procedure prefix textbox

==C# CRUD GENERATOR==
