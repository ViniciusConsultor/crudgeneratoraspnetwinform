= Details =

Initially downloaded from http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CRUD_Generator.aspx

What then added:
  * The ability to provide usernames and passwords so as to connect to remote database.
  * A checkbox to run drop if exists clauses on stored procedures
  * Tweaked the query which returns the list of columns in tables so as to exclude timestamp columns and better handle nvarchar columns.
